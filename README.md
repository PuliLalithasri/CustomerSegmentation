Customer segmentation is a vital part of marketing and business strategy, as it helps identify distinct customer groups based on their behaviors, preferences, or demographic characteristics. Machine learning (ML) can be used effectively for segmentation using clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering. Below is a step-by-step guide to performing customer segmentation analysis using Python.

1. Load and Explore Data
First, ensure you have a dataset that includes relevant customer data, such as demographic, transactional, or behavioral features
2. Preprocess Data

Preprocessing is critical to ensure data quality.

Handle missing values
Normalize or scale numerical data
Encode categorical features
Remove duplicates

3. Choose Clustering Algorithm
Common algorithms for clustering include:

K-Means: Fast and works well for spherical clusters.
DBSCAN: Detects clusters with varying densities.
Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters.

4. Visualize Clusters
Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or pair plots.

5. Interpret Results
Analyze the clusters based on their feature means to understand the characteristics of each group.

6. Save and Use the Model
Save the clustering model and apply it to new customer data for segmentation
